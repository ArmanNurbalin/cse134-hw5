For the website I added responsiveness for mobile view which was missing so now on mobile view it should scale properly without empty gaps. I added a hamburger menu for the nav bar on mobile view. Some stylistic changes were made based on the feedback given such as the h1 is now clickable and brings back to the home page. The colors were adjusted of the clickable nav bars. JS was added so that the hamburger menu works properly.
